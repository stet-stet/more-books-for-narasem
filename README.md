# What is this?

This is an haphazard attempt at gathering some info from http://lib1.kostat.go.kr/search.
As per the request made by the librarian, I wanted to find books that 

1. Are not kept in Narasem Library,
2. Are in the database anyways
3. Are currently sold in Kyobo.
4. Are categorized as 310.111, 310.112, or 310.113 by the Korean Decimal Classification Table.

# How can I make use of this?

**Make use of Kyobo.py**, perhaps?
Kyobo.py scraps information from Korea's Kyobo bookstore, and checks if the book with the isbn given is being sold there.
I doubt it is perfect, though.

Oh, and..

# Disclaimer

The codes kept here are not, by any means, pythonic or well-written, let alone well-documented.
A Lot of things are hard-coded, 
**This is a great example of what not to do when developing pretty much anything**.
I have a long way to go.

# The Lesson

* Unless you first take a good look at the site you are going to scrap, you are going to waste a LOT of time.
* So take a better look at stuff. please.
